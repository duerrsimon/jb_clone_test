Welcome to Jupyter Book
============================

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to get started.

If you only want to use the workflow that copies the files to a public student version use `.github/workflows/.publish.yml`. 
If you want to build the teacher and student jupyter books and deploy them check `.github/workflows/build-book.yml` (teacher version) and `build-book.yml` (student version). The student action is copied into the public student repo into the `.github/workflows/` folder and therefore only executed there. 

Check [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org) page for more details. You can use different configuration for student and teacher version.
